# AR Translator App Documentation

## Overview
AR Translator is a mobile application that aims to provide real-time object detection and translation using AR (Augmented Reality) technology. Currently implemented as a simulation, the app demonstrates the concept of pointing your device at objects to identify them and provide translations in your target language.

## Current Implementation

### Core Features
- **Simulated AR Experience**: The app currently uses a simulation that randomly selects objects from a predefined list when scanning.
- **Object Translation**: Translates detected objects from English to several target languages (Spanish, French, German, etc.)
- **Modern UI**: Dark-themed interface with glowing elements and card-based design.
- **Interactive Elements**: Speech assistance features through modal bottom sheets.

### Technical Stack
- **Framework**: Flutter
- **Dependencies**:
  - UI: Google Fonts, Lottie (animations)
  - Camera: Camera package, permission handler
  - AR: ARCore Flutter plugin (currently in simulation mode)
  - ML/Translation: Google ML Kit (text recognition, language ID)
  - State Management: Provider
  - Navigation: Go Router

## Future Goals

### Short-term Improvements
1. **Implement Real AR Object Detection**: Replace simulation with actual camera-based object detection using ML Kit or TensorFlow Lite.
2. **Enhance Translation Accuracy**: Integrate with professional translation APIs for more accurate results.
3. **Expand Language Support**: Add more languages and dialectic variations.

### Medium-term Goals
1. **Real-time Translation**: Enable live translation of spoken language as indicated by the "Live Translation" feature.
2. **AR Markers and Labels**: Overlay translations directly on objects in AR view.
3. **Offline Mode**: Allow basic functionality without internet connection.
4. **User Customization**: Let users add custom objects and translations to the database.

### Long-term Vision
1. **Multi-modal Recognition**: Detect not just objects but text, gestures, and environments.
2. **Conversation Assistant**: Provide contextual conversation assistance for travelers.
3. **AR Navigation**: Add direction capabilities with translated signage.
4. **Learning Mode**: Include features to help users learn new languages through everyday objects.

## Language Testing Support (PTE)

### PTE-Focused Features
1. **Vocabulary Builder**: Categorized everyday objects to expand vocabulary for PTE tests.
2. **Pronunciation Practice**: Audio playback of object names with accent options.
3. **Reading Section Prep**: Identify and translate complex text in real-world situations.
4. **Real-time Feedback**: Assess spoken descriptions of objects against standard pronunciations.

### Implementation Strategy
- Create specific PTE practice modules within the app
- Include common objects and scenarios from PTE exams
- Provide scoring and improvement tracking for test preparation
- Implement specific drills that mirror PTE test formats

## Job Interview Preparation

### Interview-Centric Features
1. **Industry-Specific Vocabulary**: Specialized vocabulary sets for different career fields.
2. **Common Interview Objects**: Recognition and description of objects typically found in interview settings.
3. **Conversation Practice**: Simulated interview scenarios with language assistance.
4. **Cultural Context**: Provide cultural notes on business etiquette across different regions.

### Development Plan
- Create dedicated "Interview Prep" mode with relevant scenarios
- Include formal business language training
- Develop role-playing features for interview practice
- Provide feedback on formality and appropriateness of language

## Technical Architecture

### Main Components
1. **AR Widget**: Central UI component for AR interactions (`lib/widgets/ar_widget.dart`)
2. **AR Service**: Handles AR functionality (`lib/services/ar_service.dart`)
3. **Translation Service**: Manages object recognition and translation

### Data Flow
1. User activates scan feature
2. Camera feed passes to object detection system
3. Detected objects are identified and processed
4. Translations are retrieved from local database or API
5. Results are displayed to the user
